            The principle of linguistic relativity holds that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition. Popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, or Whorfianism, 
            the principle is often defined to include two versions. The strong version says that language determines thought, and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories, whereas the weak version 
            says that linguistic categories and usage only influence thought and decisions.

            The term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis" is considered a misnomer by linguists for several reasons: Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf 
            never co-authored any works, and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. 
            The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later 
            invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often in their writings their views of this relativity 
            principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms.[1][2]

            The idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers, such as Wilhelm von Humboldt,who saw language as the expression of the spirit of a nation. 
            Members of the early 20th-century school of American anthropology headed by Franz Boas and Edward Sapir also embraced forms of the idea to one extent or another, including in a 1928 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America[3], 
            but Sapir in particular wrote more often against than in favor of anything like linguistic determinism. Sapir's student, Benjamin Lee Whorf, came to be seen as the primary 
            proponent as a result of his published observations of how he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences in human cognition and behavior. Harry Hoijer, one of Sapir's students, 
            introduced the term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis",[4] even though the two scholars never formally advanced any such hypothesis.[5] A strong version of relativist 
            theory was developed from the late 1920s by the German linguist Leo Weisgerber.
